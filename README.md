This is an assignment from The Odin Project web development course. We have been provided with an image and are meant to create a website from it. Will update this README.md later.

I just sent the last commit for this project. I sure spent some time with the CSS positioning. It was pretty fun to work on. I switched to nvim and I'm currently enjoying a nice plugins for code completion. I also found a nodejs live-server plugin to automatically reflect my CSS changes so that was cool. 
This project a nice and short Landing Page template meant for practice from the web development course The Odin Project. 
On to the next project now. Thanks for stopping by.
